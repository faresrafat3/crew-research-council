## [DEEP DIVE]: Industry Benchmarks, Team-Specific Targets, Visualization, and Leading Indicators

### 1. Industry Benchmarks for Each Metric

| Metric | Google [VT, 2022; Bell et al., 2018] | Microsoft [SQRBOK, 2025] | Stripe [KnowMBA, 2025] | Meta [ArXiv, 2025] | Crew v2 Target |
|--------|------|----------|--------|------|----------------|
| Line coverage | 80% (recommended) | 75-85% | 80% | 70-90% | 80% |
| Branch coverage | 70% | 65-75% | 75% | 60-80% | 70/75% |
| Mutation score | — | — | — | 60-80% | 70/80% |
| Flake rate | 1.5% reported, 16% some | <2% | <1% | <2% | <1% blocking |
| False-positive rate | — | — | — | — | <2% |
| Escape rate | — | <1/20 tasks | — | — | <1/20 |
| PBT depth | — | — | — | 2-5 props/func | >=2 |
| E2E count | — | 5-15 journeys | — | — | <=10 FULL |
| PR gate time | <10 min | <15 min | <10 min | — | <10 min |
| Test count/day | 150M | — | — | — | N/A (per-task) |

**Key benchmark sources:**
- Google: 150M tests/day, 1.5% flaky, 4.56% of failures from flakes [VT, 2022; Bell et al., 2018]
- 100% line coverage with 4% mutation score proves execution without assertion [ArXiv, 2025]
- 80% coverage is reasonable; 100% is vanity producing low-value tests [PrecisionAI, 2026]
- DeFlaker: 95.5% recall, 1.5% false alarms on 1,874 flakes [Bell et al., 2018]

### 2. Setting Team-Specific Targets

**Target-setting methodology** [KnowMBA, 2025; TMMi Foundation, 2018]:

1. **Baseline first**: Run 20 tasks with no gates. Measure actual coverage, mutation, flake, escape rates.
2. **Set targets at P50 + 1σ**: If baseline coverage is 65%, target 75% (not 90% immediately).
3. **Tighten every quarter**: Increase targets by 5% absolute each quarter until industry benchmark is reached.
4. **Never set targets below baseline**: If baseline mutation is 40%, don't set 70% immediately — set 55% first.

**Crew v2 specific targets (evidence-based):**

| Metric | Baseline (COORD-01/02) | Phase 2 Target | Phase 3 Target | Phase 4 Target |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Line coverage | 0% | 60% | 80% | 85% |
| Mutation score | 0% | 50% | 70% | 80% |
| Flake rate | unknown | <5% | <2% | <1% |
| REQ-coverage | 0% | 70% | 90% | 95% |
| RED-witness | 0% | 80% | 100% | 100% |
| Escape rate | unknown | <1/10 | <1/20 | <1/30 |

**Target adjustment rules:**
- If appeal success > 5%: loosen threshold by 5% absolute.
- If escape rate >= 1/10: tighten threshold by 5% absolute.
- If FP rate > 5%: loosen and add lint rules.
- If gate time > 10 min: slim suite or parallelize.

### 3. Visualizing Test Quality Over Time

**Dashboard layers** [GitHub Community, 2025; CTRF, 2026]:

| Layer | Tool | What It Shows |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 1. PR-level | CTRF GitHub Action | Flaky summary, pass/fail per PR |
| 2. Artifact | `upload-artifact` + `dorny/test-reporter` | JUnit XML, coverage JSON, mutation report |
| 3. Trend | Custom dashboard (Grafana/HTML) | Coverage/mutation/flake trend over 30 tasks |
| 4. Audit | Ledger DB query | Per-agent FP/FN, per-test 20-run history |

**CTRF report structure** [CTRF, 2026]:
```json
{
  "results": {
    "tool": { "name": "pytest" },
    "summary": {
      "tests": 42, "passed": 40, "failed": 1, "flaky": 1,
      "start": 1706828654274, "stop": 1706828655782
    },
    "tests": [
      { "name": "test_currency_conversion", "status": "passed", "duration": 801 },
      { "name": "test_flaky_network", "status": "flaky", "duration": 1200 }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Trend chart metrics (30-task rolling window):**
- Line coverage (target: 80%)
- Mutation score (target: 70%)
- Flake rate (target: <1%)
- Escape rate (target: <1/20)
- Gate duration (target: <10 min)
- RED-witness rate (target: 100%)

**Visualization tools:**
- GitHub Pages: host static HTML dashboard from `gh-pages` branch
- Allure Report: `pytest --alluredir=allure-results`, upload as artifact
- Grafana: query ledger DB for real-time metrics
- Simple: `coverage html` generates `htmlcov/index.html` per run

### 4. Leading Indicators That Predict Test Effectiveness

**Leading indicators** (predict future quality, not just report past quality) [KnowMBA, 2025; ArXiv, 2025]:

| Leading Indicator | What It Predicts | How to Measure | Warning Threshold |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Mutation survivor count** | Future escape rate | mutmut survivors per task | >10% survivors |
| **Flake rate trend** | CI trust erosion | 20-run history slope | Positive slope |
| **RED-miss rate** | Engineer compliance | % DONE without RED | >5% |
| **Oracle violation rate** | Test quality decay | Lint count per task | >0 |
| **Appeal success rate** | Tester calibration | Overturned blocks / total | >5% |
| **Coverage/mutation gap** | False confidence | coverage% - mutation% | >20% gap |
| **PBT depth** | Edge case coverage | @given count per function | <2 |
| **Quarantine age** | Flake debt | Days sidelined | >14 days |
| **KB lag** | Prevention decay | Escapes without KB entry | >0 |
| **Rounds to green** | Engineer TDD skill | Fix iterations per HOLD | >3 |

**Predictive model:**
- If mutation survivors > 10% AND coverage/mutation gap > 20%: predict escape rate will exceed 1/10 within 10 tasks. Action: tighten mutation gate.
- If flake rate trend is positive AND quarantine age > 7 days: predict CI trust will erode. Action: enforce 14-day fix/delete SLA.
- If RED-miss rate > 5%: predict engineer SOUL is not being followed. Action: re-add iron law, audit SOUL.

**Lagging indicators** (report past quality, for comparison):
- Escape rate (confirmed bugs in production)
- False-positive rate (overturned blocks)
- Drill pass rate (broken REQs caught)
